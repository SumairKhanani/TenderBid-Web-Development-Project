Problem statement:

We are on the mission of resolving a crisis for a lot of small and medium
enterprises, who are looking for contractors with the least price and
best quality. This platform aims to find contractors who have applied to
the companies and help them understand the process and make the
transition smooth. This platform is the best place where we can gather
all contractors who bid on the project set by the company.



Abstract:

Our website will have a simple and clean user interface and will have
three user roles that are admin, consumers, and contractors. Separate
credentials will be stored for both consumers and contractors;
moreover, admin will also have to login in order to gain access to the
database. Consumers will post his project and requirements while the
contractors will bid on that project. One with the lowest bid will
eventually win and get connected to the consumer for the project.
TenderBid aims to get the work done in the lowest cost and the best
quality for the consumers.
